# How to Contribute

If you're interested in contributing new features requests, synthesis research, bug fixes, or desired enhancements to decentralized interfaces, DIY nodes, and Stable Diffusion integrations, you are always encouraged to open an issue, ask questions, or make note of anything that might be unclear, confusing, or just plain out of place.

Please follow the contribution steps for a general workflow of what contributions might look like before submitting a pull request...
