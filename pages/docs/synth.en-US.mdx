# Why Image Synth?

<div style={{ border: '1px solid #888', padding: '1rem 2.5rem', textAlign: 'center', marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '3rem' }}>
_This century has given the world a wonderful renaissance by means of its technical acquisitions; but at the same time its miraculous improvements have not been employed in the service of humanity. Distance has ceased to be an obstacle, yet we complain of insufficient space. Our great steamships carry us swiftly and surely over hitherto unvisited seas. Our railways carry us safely into a mountain-world heretofore tremblingly scaled on foot._

_Now, I am of opinion that electric light was not invented for the purpose of illuminating the drawing-rooms of a few snobs, but rather for the purpose of throwing light on some of the dark problems of humanity._

– Theodor Herzl

Some might believe the height of art and human accomplishment is to make sure a select few can maintain the repetitive work they are most comfortable with. Others, like us, are more focused on how to draw light into the darkness... with image synthesis we mean that literally.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_These AI models are tools that can:_<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_1. Make mundane image output easier_<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_2. Provide new ways of ideating for artists_<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_3. Allow millions more to become artists_<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_4. Will create loads of new creative jobs_<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_5. Tool = poorly paid worker_<br />

Usually, when a new breakthrough in technology and tooling expands the limits of human capacity, many of those who were comfortable with the way things were (and whatever protections from competition they thought they had).

Image synthesis does exactly that. It changes what we are capable of by opening the prospect of universal access to powerful new instruments of self-expression, storytelling, creativity, and artistry, nearly obliterating artificial constraints on the supply of high quality content in the process. Depending on your economic school of thought, maybe that's a bad thing. We choose to see it as an opportunity to generate more value and diversify participation as every citizen of humanity with a decent internet connection gets to explore more vividly what it is that makes us human.

While low skilled, repetitive, race to the bottom artwork comissions for corporations with minimal dedication to the quality of work will get replaced by push-button prompt automation, we don't believe that's where the action is. Instead, even lower skilled almost-artists will now be more likely to discover and hone their latent talents – millions who never would have truly considered it possible before will now get to be artists. These machines enables them and society at large will benefit from this.

Don't even get us started on what happens when it spreads into machine to machine manufacturity and more profound decentralization... yet.
