# Why DIY?

"We are working so that the AI that helps us maximise our potential is open and owned by all, not centralised and feeding on us." -- Emad Mostaque

"Centralized AI is itself unethical. Real inclusion isn’t putting fake people of multiple races in a centralized AI, it’s giving real people of all backgrounds equal access to decentralized AI." – Balaji Srinivasan
