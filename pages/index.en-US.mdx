**DIY SYNTH** is a living history for experimentation, adaptation, common edge cases, and uncommon findings from the image synthesis research community. It is an inherently open, massive multiplayer search mechanism.

We had no other choice. I'm sure you can relate. While we keep exploring the outer bounds of memes, culture and society, we need a place to build new understandings of what we can do now with each new prompt, "run all" and "CUDA out of memory" error.

Besides, it's far too interesting to leave DIY synthesis research in the hands of proprietary future models that can't be trusted not to write us out of our own stories.
