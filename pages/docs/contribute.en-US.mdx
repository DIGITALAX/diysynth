Good engineering is expensive enough that it's silly to go at it all alone. A second pair of eyes, rubber ducking at just the right time, or a good shoulder to lean on can make all the difference while we trek across the uncharted image synth frontiers. Besides, who doesn't want to get a peek at what everyone else is synthesizing before the best of it is shared in public?
